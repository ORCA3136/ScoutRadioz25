# Welcome to O.R.C.A. 3136's ScoutRadioz scouting forms GitHub!
Please feel free to download and modify at will. We will try to keep these files updated if we make any changes throughout the season. 
These forms are a modified version of 1250's forms. We added a few fields, changed some wording, and adjusted the numbers to better fit our use case. The most notable change is the addition of a "score failed" field, which is used to calculate a scoring success percentage that is reported as a derived field.

Thanks!
