# Welcome to O.R.C.A. 3136's ScoutRadioz scouting forms GitHub!

Please feel free to download and modify at will. We will try to keep these files updated if we make any changes throughout the season. 

These forms are a modified version of 1250's forms. We added a few fields, changed some wording, and adjusted the numbers to better fit our use case. 

The most notable change is the addition of a "score failed" field, which is used to calculate a scoring success percentage that is reported as a derived field. This is applicable for both coral and algae scoring in auto and teleop.

In the match scouting form, autonomous algae is reported as one field for any scoring location, rather than one for the processor and one for the net. We found that, at our events, so few robots were scoring algae autonomously (if any were at all) that we did not use these fields, and simplified them as such to reduce the visual load. Autonomous points calculations treat any algae scored as worth 5 points in order to strike a balance between net and processor scores. We feel as though this was an acceptable compromise given our experiences.

Thanks!
